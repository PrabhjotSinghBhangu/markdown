One of the strongest arguments defending the notion that progressive enhancement ought to be the traditional model where content is always accessible is the following quote:

> No! Just because bigger companies have websites that don't work without js or css, doesn't mean you should do it too  
>  Local Developer (@LocalSourceNL) October 6, 2016

On the other hand, those who take the view that progressive enhancement has changed such that JS running on a browser can be safely assumed and that the network is now the enhancement will argue:

> In a world where your lowest common denominator is a very capable browser with a modern JavaScript engine, running on a smartphone that would have been classified as desktop-class ten years ago, but the network is now the bottleneck, what does that mean for progressive enhancement?  

Concluding paragraph:

>In my view point both, both are write it my are wish to do or not.
